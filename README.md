# React City and User Management App

This project implements a front-end application using React.js to interact with APIs for managing cities and users. It includes functionalities for adding cities, managing users within those cities, and interfacing with third-party APIs.

---

## Features

- **City Management:**
  - Add new cities
  - View list of cities

- **User Management:**
  - Add users to cities
  - Modify user details
  - View list of users in each city

- **Integration with External API:**
  - Fetch data from a third-party API (e.g., Binance API)
  - Display retrieved data in the application

---

## Technologies Used

- **Front-end:**
  - React.js
  - React Router (for navigation)
  - Axios (for API calls)
  - Bootstrap or Material-UI (for styling, choose one)
  - React Hooks (for state management)

- **Back-end (for API):**
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - PostgreSQL or MySQL (for database)
  - CryptoJS (for encryption, if needed)

---

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your development machine.
- A running Node.js server with the APIs for cities and users set up (refer to the provided Node.js backend).

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_project.git
   cd your_project/
   ```

2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the API endpoint

   - Ensure your Node.js server is running and the APIs are accessible from `http://localhost:3000` (or adjust as necessary).

4. Start the React development server
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the app running.
